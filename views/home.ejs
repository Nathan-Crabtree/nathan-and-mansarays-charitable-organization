        <div class="col-8">
            <span>PCS began with the vision of a man, Yehudah (Judah) "War Eagle" Petty. He set out to realize a better way, a way to sovereignty for all who desired to break free of the dependency on systems of enslavement. Little did he know, at the outset of his journey that it would result in a tearing down and rebuilding of all previously held belief systems and ideas, some of which he embraced quite rigidly. This path has served to dismantle falsehood and unveil truth as can only be understood when the proverbial veil has been lifted and the previously held fallacies are revealed for what they are, illusion.</span>
